# Bubble Sort Algorithm

**What is Bubble Sort?**

    Bubble sort is iterating through a list, comparing elements in the list that are adjacent to each other, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

## sort

```
constant MAX is max length of array
function sort (array):
    create integer variables i and j
    for i from zero to MAX - 1:
        for j from zero to MAX - 1:
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap array[j] with array[j+1]
                printArray(array)
```
