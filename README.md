# Bubble Sort Algorithm

**What is Bubble Sort?**

Bubble sort is going through a list, comparing elements in the list that are adjacent to each other, and swapping them if they are in the wrong order.


# Table of Contents

We will need 3 functions:
|Table of Contents|
|--------|--------|
| [printValues](#values) | test |
| test | test |
2. [sort](#sort)
3. [main](#main)

## printValues


































## sort

```
constant MAX is max length of array
function sort (array):
    create integer variables i and j
    for i from zero to MAX - 1:
        for j from zero to MAX - 1:
            if array[j] > array[j+1]:
                swap array[j] with array[j+1]
                printArray(array)
```















































## swap






































## main
